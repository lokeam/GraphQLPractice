# GraphQLPractice

A basic exercise implementing GraphQL on the server side for the purposes of putting together a GraphQL app.

Uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to simulate an outside API as well as [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for all xhr requests.

## Setup

1. `npm install` all the things.

2. `npm run dev` to run server with nodemon instance

3. `npm run json:server` to run simulated 3rd party api server

4. use [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to make simulated GraphQL queries

5. use [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to hit the simulated API server
